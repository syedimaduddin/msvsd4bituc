# VSD Mixed-signal PD Research Program 
<li> This repository contains information about a 10-week program that uses SKY130 PDK and open-source flow tools to tape out chips.
<li> Each week, participants must perform tasks and meet requirements to stay in the program.
<li> My weekly tasks and simulations are compiled in a directory for each week.
  
## Below is a summary of my activities each week
